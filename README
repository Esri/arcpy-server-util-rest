Python bindings for ArcGIS REST APIs

These are Python bindings for consuming services and administering
an ArcGIS 10.1 Server via its RESTful APIs. There are examples in
the documentation to get started.

Please note THESE ARE NOT COMPLETE -- not all of the REST API has
been wrapped or implemented. If you have a pet feature that you'd
like to see working, then by all means feel free to contribute a
patch. This has largely been a labor of love that I've done in my
free time as a proof-of-concept.
